# TeamColouredInsta
A UT99 mutator which adds team-coloured InstaGib shock rifles to the game.  

Hacked together using methods from packages: Color (a.k.a. ColorMatch) by unknown author, BTInsta/BTPlusPlus by Rush.

*Remember*, if you customise or otherwise edit this mod, *rename the package* so it doesn't cause mismatches on servers!
